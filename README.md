# GO4LUNCH [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LeothosThoren/Go4Lunch.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LeothosThoren/Go4Lunch) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/LeothosThoren/Go4Lunch/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/LeothosThoren/Go4Lunch)

The Go4Lunch app is a collaborative application used by all employees.
It allows you to search for a restaurant in the area, then select the one of your choice by sharing it with your colleagues.
In the same way, it is possible to consult the restaurants selected by colleagues to join them.
A little before lunchtime, the application notifies the various employees to invite them to join their colleagues.
